features:
  - Previously, all imported introspection rules were applied when inspecting
    any type of node. There was no mechanism to apply only a selected set of
    rules. This change improves it by introducing a `scope` field to
    introspection rules. If a scope is set on an introspection rule, it will
    only apply to nodes that have a matching 'inspection_scope' property. If
    not set, it will apply to all nodes.
